MARKDOWN_HELP: |
    ‚îÄ‚îÄ„Äå Markdown Help „Äç‚îÄ‚îÄ

    Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {dispatcher.bot.first_name} has some enhancements, to make sure that \
    saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.

    ‚ùç <code>_italic_</code>: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
    ‚ùç <code>*bold*</code>: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
    ‚ùç <code>`code`</code>: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as 'code'
    ‚ùç <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show <code>sometext</code>, \
    and tapping on it will open the page at <code>someURL</code>.
    <b>Example:</b><code>[test](example.com)</code>

    ‚ùç <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: this is a special enhancement to allow users to have telegram \
    buttons in their markdown. <code>buttontext</code> will be what is displayed on the button, and <code>someurl</code> \
    will be the url which is opened.
    <b>Example:</b> <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

    If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
    <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)
    [two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
    This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

    Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!

    *Federation*
    Everything is fun, until a spammer starts entering your group, and you have to block it. Then you need to start banning more, and more, and it hurts.
    But then you have many groups, and you don't want this spammer to be in one of your groups - how can you deal? Do you have to manually block it, in all your groups?\n
    *No longer!* With Federation, you can make a ban in one chat overlap with all other chats.\n
    You can even designate federation admins, so your trusted admin can ban all the spammers from chats you want to protect.\n
